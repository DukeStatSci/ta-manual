## Our Purpose {.unnumbered}

As a Teaching Assistant, whatever your duties, you are part of the Statistical Science Instruction Team.
In Fall 2024, we have filled over 1,400 seats in courses taught by departmental faculty to students who came to Duke from across the planet.
Students will range from almost 450 undergraduates enrolled in their first 100-level course to doctoral students nearing the end of their formal coursework.
We want students who take only one or two courses from the department to learn the usefulness, importance, and power of statistical thinking and modern methodologies.
We aim to educate students in our Statistical Science majors, minor, interdisciplinary majors, Master's, and Ph.D. programs, in particular, to be highly accomplished future leaders in statistical science, regardless of their career paths.
For all of these students, whatever their programs, we aim to provide a transformative educational experience in statistical and data science.
By joining our instructional team, you help us to deliver a meaningful learning experience to each of our students.

## The Fundamental Rule for TAs is... {.unnumbered}

**Always talk with your instructor if you have questions, concerns, or suggestions**.
Talk with the other TAs.
Talk with the DUS, the Undergraduate Coordinator, and the departmental staff.
Ask for help if you need it, ask your questions, and keep asking.
Let us know what you need in order to do your job and to do it well.

We're glad you are here and willing to help out.
Thank you!
