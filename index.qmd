## Our Purpose {.unnumbered}

As a Teaching Assistant, whatever your duties, you are part of the Statistical Science Instruction Team.
This Fall, we are offering over 1900 seats in courses to students from across the globe.
Students will range from over 500 undergraduates in their first 100-level course to doctoral students nearing the end of their formal coursework.
We want students who take only one or two courses from the department to learn the usefulness, importance, and power of statistical thinking and modern methodologies.
We aim to educate our undergraduate majors, minors and interdisciplinary majors, master's students, and Ph.D. students in particular to be highly accomplished future leaders in statistical science, regardless of their career paths.
For all of these students, whatever their programs, we aim to provide a transformative educational experience in statistical and data science.
By joining our instructional team, you help us to deliver a meaningful learning experience to each of our students.

## The Fundamental Rule for TAs is... {.unnumbered}

**Always talk with your instructor if you have questions, concerns or suggestions**.
Talk with the other TAs.
Talk with the DUS, the Undergraduate Coordinator, and the departmental staff.
Ask for help if you need it, ask your questions, and keep asking.
Let us know what you need in order to do your job and to do it well.
We're glad you are here and willing to help out.
Thank you!
