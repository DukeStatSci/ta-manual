## Evaluation

The opportunity to hold a TAship will continue contingent on good TA performance. Student and faculty evaluations of TAs will occur via surveys at the end of each semester. Excellent TA evaluations can also provide the basis for future recommendation letters from faculty. TAs can review their evaluations at the end of each semester.

We also recommend getting feedback from your students during the semester. If your instructor does not conduct a midcourse survey for anonymous student feedback and you wish to set one up for yourself, please contact Dr. Durso for help with a survey.

## Recognition

The Department of Statistical Science recognizes one doctoral student, one master's student, and one undergraduate student as TAs of the Year each spring during commencement festivities. Faculty members will be asked to nominate TAs for this award each semester (for TAs in Summer 2024, Fall 2024, and Spring 2025 courses), and a departmental committee will decide on the winners based on faculty and student evaluations. TAs of the Year will be recognized at the departmental graduation at the end of the academic year. These are cash awards, and the amount is \$1,500 for PhD TAs, \$1,000 for MS TAs, and \$750 for undergraduate TAs.
