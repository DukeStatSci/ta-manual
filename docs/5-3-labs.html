<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Labs</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Meet with the course instructor before courses begin and at least once a week during the semester to learn how the instructor would like the lab session run and to discuss upcoming labs and any issues that arise during the semester. First year graduate students have usually not learned about statistics from the same perspective as our undergrad courses, and some have never used the software that they will be teaching. Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Undergraduates may have taken the course from a different instructor whose approach is different. Talk to the instructor of this course!</p></li>
<li><p>During the first day of lab, do what you can to set the climate of the course and develop a rapport with the class. Get students to interact with you and their classmates either through introductions, small group discussion, or asking questions. Give information about yourself that helps establish that you are both credible and approachable. You will want students to leave after the first class knowing why the lab sections are important and what your expectations will be. You will want to leave after the first class knowing the students’ expectations and knowing that they are engaged enough to begin expending the time and energy needed to do well in the course.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have worked through the lab ahead of time leaving plenty of time to ask the instructor for clarification. Make sure you understand the general learning objectives. Be ready to explain to students why they are being asked to do the exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>During lab, engage the students. Encourage them to explore and play rather than simply go through the motions. Ask them questions. Be receptive to their questions. Help them make the link between the computing lab and what has been covered in the text and lectures.</p></li>
<li><p>Check in with breakout groups online, even when it looks like there are no questions. Wander around the live classroom or lab. Students are more likely to reach out and ask a question if you’re physically (or virtually) closer to them than if you’re sitting in front of the classroom. Don’t ask the Ferris Bueller query “Any questions?” Instead, “what questions do you have for me?” or “I’ll take 3 questions now” are both better ways to solicit inquiry.</p></li>
<li><p>Please avoid <em>“didactic dictation”</em>. One of the most frustrating experiences for a new user of R is to have code quickly and sometimes inaudibly dictated to them by an experienced coder who talks too fast while typing in unreadably tiny font on a screen half the class can’t see, and allows no time for correction, troubleshooting, or questions. (Use .Rmd files for that instead.) Live coding, where you are demonstrating something as you talk about it, and students code along, should be done slowly. You don’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes and correct them, modeling authentic coding for your students. Demonstrate first, and then have students work on their own code. Watch for frustration. Address it positively.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Excellent suggestions for how to do this well can be found <a href="https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/golive-uscots/golive.html#1">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you have suggestions for improving the lab materials or find errors in the lab instructions, please discuss them with your instructor.</p></li>
<li><p>It may be a hardship for some students to have to use their cameras during an online lab session, but make sure to set expectations. You can’t see how they are doing if their cameras off the whole session. Try at least starting with cameras on for a check-in. Talk with the instructor about setting expectations. Do activities to keep them engaged even if the cameras are not able to be used.</p></li>
