In Fall 2024, we have filled over 1,400 seats in courses taught by departmental faculty to students who came to Duke from across the planet. Students will range from almost 450 undergraduates enrolled in their first 100-level course to doctoral students nearing the end of their formal coursework. We want students who take only one or two courses from the department to learn the usefulness, importance, and power of statistical thinking and modern methodologies. We aim to educate students in our Statistical Science majors, minor, interdisciplinary majors, Master’s, and Ph.D. programs, in particular, to be highly accomplished future leaders in statistical science, regardless of their career paths. For all of these students, whatever their programs, we aim to provide a transformative educational experience in statistical and data science. By joining our instructional team, you help us to deliver a meaningful learning experience to each of our students.",

For whiteboarding during online office hours, you can turn your cell phone into a document camera by aiming it at a paper or whiteboard. If your computer or laptop fails, please get in touch with the instructor immediately. If needed, the department has some emergency loaners so you can continue to succeed in the interim.\nBooks: You should never have to purchase a textbook for a course you’re TAing. Many courses now have electronic versions of the text available for free online or through the Duke Libraries. Additionally, the DUS Assistant, has copies of textbooks you can borrow for the duration of your TAship. Make sure to return the book at the end of the semester.\nCanvas: Canvas is a university-wide course development and presentation platform known as a Learning Management System (LMS).1 You can access Canvas with your Net ID at https://canvas.duke.edu; however, your course faculty must manually add you to their course. Canvas allows faculty (and TAs if the faculty gives permission) to post course information such as lecture notes, assignments, announcements, exam solutions, and other teaching materials to which you want your students to have access. Note that undergraduate TAs are not supposed to have access to the entire gradebook in Canvas; however, you may be able to do anonymous grading. Canvas also offers features for sending emails to individuals or groups, hosting online discussions, collecting homework assignments, and posting and viewing grades. Canvas may also be used to organize Zoom meetings for office hours.\nFor an overview of capabilities and various tutorials, go to https://go.canvas.duke.edu/training-materials/introduction-canvas/. Duke Learning Innovation and Lifetime Education (LILE) also periodically offers Canvas training. Your required TA training may also include Canvas training. For any questions about Canvas, consult your course faculty or the Undergraduate Coordinator. Learning Innovation also offers training on Canvas.\nCourse website: Many courses have public course websites that contain / link to course materials. Familiarize yourself with the course website.\nDiscussion and communication tools: Ed Discussions is a common choice for an online discussion tool, as it’s built into Canvas. Some faculty members may use tools not built into Canvas, such as Piazza or Slack. Once your instructor has chosen a discussion tool, ensure you’re familiar with it or ask for training on the tool from your instructor or the Undergraduate Coordinator. Note that some courses use different communication tools to teach team communication and communication with students. Note that some faculty might choose not to use an online discussion tool.\nGradescope: Gradescope is an online grading tool that can be integrated with Canvas. Gradescope is used extensively in the department, and all TAs will be trained in its use. If your instructor is using it, and you haven’t used it before, ask questions / ask for training to understand how best to complete your grading duties fully. You can access Gradescope through Canvas or directly by logging in with your Net ID. Discuss with your instructor if you have previously used Gradescope for grading and think it would assist your course duties this semester. If you or the instructor would like help with Gradescope, ask the Undergraduate Coordinator for course-specific training.\nCopies: If your instructor asks you to make physical copies for the course, please email the DUS Assistant and cc the Undergraduate Coordinator for access and instructions.\nSupplies: Please inform your instructor of any unmet supply needs, such as chalk, dry-erase markers, red pens, etc., for instructional and grading purposes. If these items are missing in a TA office hours space, please let the DUS Assistant and the Undergraduate Coordinator know.\nComputing labs: All introductory undergraduate labs in StatSci are bring-your-own-device labs. Large introductory classes often use OIT-provided Docker containers for computing. Graduate courses often use department servers. Graduate and experienced undergraduate TAs usually supervise the computing lab sections. In larger courses, undergraduate TAs might also be assigned as lab helpers. If you’re new to your courses’ computing environment, you should ask for help from the instructor and the Undergraduate Coordinator.",

If students show up inappropriately dressed, please discuss the issue with the instructor.\n\nFor online office hours:\n\nUse an appropriate virtual background if your computer can handle it. Try to be in a dull environment, not a distracting one. A bookcase, office space, living room, or yard are fine backgrounds. Be sure to have adequate lighting. Sometimes, it is just a matter of facing a different direction. There is no need to buy a ring light, but many YouTube videos show you how to set up a suitable environment for leading an online session.\nIf your environment is noisy, use a headset and mute yourself when you are not speaking.

    "text": "4.3 Labs\n\nMeet with the instructor before courses begin and at least once a week during the semester to learn how the instructor would like the lab session run and discuss upcoming labs and any issues that arise.\nDuring the first day of lab, do what you can to set the course climate and develop a rapport with the class. Get students to interact with you and their classmates either through introductions, small group discussions, or asking questions. Give information about yourself that helps establish that you are both credible and approachable. You will want students to leave after the first class knowing why the lab sections are essential and what your expectations will be. After the first class, you will want to leave knowing the students’ expectations and knowing they are engaged enough to begin expending the time and energy needed to do well in the course.\nEnsure you have worked through the lab beforehand, leaving ample time to ask the instructor and Head TA for clarification. Make sure you understand the general learning objectives. Be ready to explain to students why they are being asked to do the exercise.\n\nDuring the lab, engage the students. Please encourage them to explore and play rather than go through the motions. Ask them questions. Be receptive to their questions. Help them link the computing lab to what has been covered in the text and lectures.\n\nPlease avoid “didactic dictation”. One of the most frustrating experiences for a new coder is to have code quickly and sometimes inaudibly dictated to them by an experienced coder who talks too fast while typing in unreadably tiny font on a screen half the class can’t see and allows no time for correction, troubleshooting, or questions. Live coding should be done slowly, where you demonstrate something as you talk about it, and students code along. You don’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes and correct them, modeling authentic coding for your students. If you make a mistake or get an error, model the process of troubleshooting by talking through finding the issue and making corrections. Demonstrate first, and then have students work on their code. Watch for frustration. Address it positively. Suggestions for how to do this incredibly well can be found here.\nWander around the classroom and check in with students (or teams of students) even when there are no questions. If there are many questions, establish a procedure you will use to answer them fairly and in some order. Students are more likely to reach out and ask a question if you’re physically closer to them than if you’re sitting in front of the classroom. Don’t just ask “Any questions?” Instead, ask, “@hat questions do you have for me?” or say, “I’ll take three questions now,” which are better ways to solicit inquiry.\nIf you have suggestions for improving the lab materials or find errors in the lab instructions, discuss them with your instructor. Be sure you understand how corrections will be made for later lab sections when an early lab TA discovers a needed correction.",

    "text": "4.4 Office Hours\nTO DO: First, add some language about in-person office hours, then add a bullet point about online hours.\n\nMany instructors will set up Zoom office hours rooms via Canvas. Practices may differ between instructors, but it is a good idea to set up a Google sheet that stays linked in Canvas and can be used for students to indicate their questions or needs during the session if online. This will help you manage the crowd that could show up. You will find an example of this in the TA training site in Canvas.\nMake sure you have read the text and class notes. Use the same notation, definitions, and perspectives as the text’s author and the class’s instructor.\nMake sure to convey your interest in helping students. Sitting in the help room (or on Zoom) doing your own homework and not making eye contact with an entering student will often convey to the student that you are not interested in helping. Learn their names, and offer yours.\nAvoid solving homework problems for students. Giving students the answer does not help them develop the problem-solving skills necessary for them to do well in the course. Ask guiding, probing questions, but get the student to think. Offer similar problems as examples to work through together. Your students should expect to have their questions answered, but they should not expect you to give them the answers to the homework questions. Never tell students their work is correct; this will lead to problems if you are wrong.\nStudents differ in their mathematical preparation, and for our undergraduate courses, students will often be very rusty on algebra or calculus, depending on the course. Be sure to work from the student’s level. If a student is in trouble beyond your abilities, refer them to the instructor.\nMake sure to speak clearly, slowly, and audibly in person or online. Do not assume your students know a particular theorem or distribution if it has not been used in the course. Speak respectfully and let them know the course is meant to be challenging, but success happens with practice and sufficient time spent on the work.\nWhen you don’t know how to work to the answer, do NOT fake it. Be honest, and seek another TA or the instructor. Giving a student incorrect information will snowball into a more significant problem. If you promise to get back to them, write it down and follow it up. Share with your peer TAs or ask in a discussion forum on the TA training site.\nLet the instructor know if you have students struggling with the material or not knowing where to begin. It’s hard for anyone to ask for help if they are not used to needing it. Be kind and patient with students who show up feeling panicked or anxious. Contact Duke Reach at https://students.duke.edu/wellness/dukereach/ if you suspect they need help, and let the instructor know. But mostly, be kind. You were a beginner once, and the student may be lost or have not learned how to study in an online course. Help them, and get help with this if it’s a problem. Kindness and patience are the best compliments in TA evaluations.",

Instead, please review the content and discuss it with the instructor or other course TAs.\nGrade like a human, not a machine. Use your judgment, and check in with the instructor or the Head TA if you’re unsure if a student’s solution is good enough, even if it doesn’t exactly match the key. Note that being able to do this appropriately and fairly requires that you have mastered the course content.\nUnderstand the policies for partial credit, late assignments, etc., and apply them consistently.\nFind out from the instructor whether they expect you to make the solution key or grading rubric, including answers and a breakdown of how points will be distributed. Ask the instructor to review it before it goes live.\nGrade by question, i.e., grade all of question 1, then all of question 2, etc. This will facilitate greater consistency. You may be assigned only one or a few questions from an entire assignment, mainly if you use Gradescope.\nIf you are sharing grading duties, calibrate for consistency. Students will be frustrated and angry if graders differ in their process of assigning points (and you will hear about it!).\nRecord grades per the instructor’s instructions, and always double-check your work.\nCheck with the instructor on how to enter missing grades, i.e., with a blank or a zero. Blanks can play havoc with scoring algorithms that require replacing minimums. This also depends on whether you are grading within Gradescope or in Canvas.\nFinish all grading within one week of receiving the grading assignment unless otherwise instructed by your instructor.

Some time-limiting techniques are helpful, but students with accommodations must also be helped. Hundreds of companies are willing to sell students answers to problem sets, quizzes, and exams; using these services is likely to violate the Duke Community Standard.

In Fall 2024, we are not requiring a technology check for Zoom-readiness but that training will be provided upon request (reach out to the Undergraduate Coordinator with your request). We expect that you will get training on other technologies as they pertain to your course (Gradescope, Canvas, etc.) from your course instructor. If you feel that you have not been trained adequately on a technology you’re expected to use, please reach out to your course instructor and/or c and we’ll make sure this training happens promptly.\nYou have been assigned to STATSCI TA Fa24, the departmental training Canvas site for TAs, as the main TA training site. Training may be added as needed as the semester proceeds and we’ll inform you with a Canvas announcement from there. There is required training on TA duties, on preventing harassment, on other topics as required by the University, and on the learning technologies needed in your course.",

Your instructor might drop in on your labs or office hours from time to time and so might the Undergraduate Coordinator or any others involved with course management. You will train and work with them to develop your skills so that each semester that you have a TAship, you are ready for more responsibilities and leadership roles. You can also request a lab observation after a few weeks, for suggestions and feedback. Lab observations of all TAs leading labs or discussion sections will be offered in Weeks 3 - 5.

    "text": "7.3 Further Training\nLearning Innovation & Lifetime Education (LILE) offers workshops and other training opportunities. Upcoming LILE workshops can be found at https://lile.duke.edu/events.\nAdditionally, the Graduate School has many training opportunities for students interested in teaching: https://gradschool.duke.edu. Some specific opportunities that might be of interest are listed below.\n\n7.3.1 Certificate in College Teaching\nThe Certificate in College Teaching program prepares doctoral students to teach and formally documents this professional development to make you more competitive when applying for positions. Students who complete the CCT will have it listed on their transcripts as an officially endorsed Duke University Graduate School certificate. The CCT combines departmental training and resources with programming from The Graduate School to give you systematic pedagogical training that helps you develop as a teacher and allows you to use your time more efficiently as you balance your research and teaching responsibilities. The Certificate in College Teaching program has three major requirements:\n\nCoursework (2 courses)\nTeaching experience and observation\nOnline teaching portfolio\n\nThe program requirements take about a year to complete, but that may vary as opportunities for gaining teaching experience vary across departments. CCT work may be done alongside other classes, research, or work on a dissertation and should not significantly interfere with the timely completion of any of these. After you apply to the CCT program, the program director will meet with you to review the requirements and your timeline for completing them. Discuss your CCT activities with your instructor and the Department if you need assistance scheduling observations, etc. You may complete the Triad teaching observation requirement during any semester you are TAing or teaching.\nTwo Statistical Science courses have been developed and count towards this Certificate:\n\nSTA 771S - Teaching Statistics\nSTA 772S - Mentoring Undergraduate STEM Research\n\n\n\n7.3.2 BASS Instructional Fellowships\nThe Bass Instructional Fellowship Program supports high-quality teaching experiences for Ph.D. students where normal means of funding are unavailable. It also helps students become more knowledgeable in online college teaching. The program offers fellowships for\n\ninstructors of record (Bass IORs),\ninstructional teaching assistants (Bass TAs), and\nonline apprentices (Bass OAs).\n\nRecipients of Bass Instructional Fellowships will receive compensatory payment at the level of Arts and Sciences teaching assistants and a scholarship covering full or partial tuition and fees for their semester of participation. This effectively “buys out” that much of any existing fellowship or financial support; the student will not net any additional pay. A Bass Instructional Fellowship should not lessen a student’s competitiveness for other fellowships. If the student wins another fellowship after having also won a Bass Fellowship, that other fellowship can be decreased by the amount provided by the Bass Fellowship so that there is no penalty or disadvantage to receiving a Bass at the same time (unless terms of the other fellowship prohibit this arrangement).\n\n\n7.3.3 College Teaching Workshops\nCollege Teaching Workshops are an annual workshop series open to Duke graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff. Invited speakers in this series will draw upon their experience to address topics relevant to classroom teaching, dealing with students, or faculty life and career paths. You will learn how to: - recognize the complex dimensions of classroom teaching and faculty life, - analyze difficult teaching situations and respond creatively, - improve your teaching skills by drawing upon various resources at Duke, - plan and design courses with the student perspective in mind, and - engage in scholarly conversations about college teaching and learning.",

You can review this list with the instructor to determine the tasks that will be part of your Head TA responsibilities.\n\n8.3.1.1 Office hours\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, ensure each TA has scheduled their allotted office hours (at least 2 hours weekly), has the necessary room reserved, and has Zoom links set up.\nEnsure office hours are well distributed throughout the week as much as possible to meet the students’ needs.\n\n\n\n8.3.1.2 Total TA hours\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, obtain the number of expected hours for each TA from the instructor and, when requested, compare them to assigned tasks.\nCheck in with other TAs about the hours they work weekly; adjust grading assignments, as needed, to help keep their hours consistent and within their limits. If the workload cannot be allocated fairly and people remain within their limits, notify the instructor.\n\n\n\n8.3.1.3 Gradescope\n\nWork with the instructor at the beginning of the semester to ensure all TAs know how to use Gradescope. Give a demonstration or facilitate a help session for TAs, as needed. \nIf requested, set up assignments in Gradescope and Canvas and make the links for synchronization through the Modules tool in Canvas.\n\nEnsure grading rubrics are set up using the instructor’s preferred grading convention (positive scoring, negative scoring, or a combination of both).  Include any other rubric items requested by the instructor, such as a “needs review” rubric item.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.1.4 Grading\n\nMake grading assignments for all TAs. Each question should be graded by one TA for all submissions in a given assignment, with a rare exception if this is not feasible for particular questions.\n\nThe number of questions to assign to each TA will be based on the total hours allowed and other TA responsibilities (e.g., labs, office hours, classroom). The instructor will provide the total hours and responsibilities. \n\nSet up a clear communication line so TAs may ask questions about grading assignments\nMake sure all TAs complete grading (lab and lecture) within a week (or less during summer). This includes\n\nKeep track of progress and gently remind TAs when the grading deadline is approaching.\nSend personal reminders to TAs with little to no grading completed the day before the deadline. Notify the instructor if any TAs regularly need these reminders.\nIf grading isn’t done by the due date, remind the TA. If you cannot contact the TA or grading is still not completed within the agreed-upon time frame, notify the instructor immediately to follow up with TAs not finishing their grading.\n\nWhen the grading deadline has passed, do a first pass on graded items marked “needs review” by other TAs. Then, notify the instructor if any questions need instructor feedback before finalizing.\nSpot-check the quality of written feedback and let the TAs know if they need to improve the quality of feedback. (Note: The second Head TA training session will mainly focus on how to do this.)\nWork with the instructor to determine the process for handling regrade requests. If asked by the instructor, do a first pass on regrade requests, providing feedback on each one. Notify the instructor if any others need instructor feedback before finalizing.\n\n\n\n8.3.1.5 Additional tasks\n\nAt the end of drop/add, remind the instructor to remove any students from the GitHub organization that have dropped the class. \nAt the end of the semester, reflect on how the Head TA role went, whether the training was useful, etc., by responding to the Head TA survey.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Pedagogical tasks\nYou may be asked to do some or all of the pedagogical tasks throughout the semester. You can review this list with the instructor to determine the tasks that will be part of your Head TA responsibilities.\n\n8.3.2.1 Peer evaluations\n\nSchedule peer evaluations in Teammates or software preferred by the instructor. The instructor will provide the dates of the peer evaluation. Note that Canvas also has peer evaluation tools for grading; you may wish to test it.\nWhen peer evaluations are due, read through the “instructor only” comments and write a one-page summary notifying the instructor how the teams are generally doing, if there are any common pain points in the class (e.g., not scheduling a time to meet), and any groups that may be having trouble. Any especially good groups are nice to mention, too!\n\n\n\n8.3.2.2 Assignments & grading rubric\n\nReview assignment instructions and notify the instructor of anything confusing or unclear. \nReview the grading rubric and notify the instructor of any errors or inconsistencies in the instructions and rubric.\n\nTalk with the instructor at the beginning of the semester to establish expectations on when they will have the grading rubrics ready for review. \n\nMake minor updates and corrections to assignments when requested; instructors are responsible for lab creation and major updates.\nIf it is not feasible to schedule a weekly meeting with all TAs and the instructor due to unavoidable scheduling conflicts, work with the instructor to record TA meetings via Zoom and share meeting recordings with other TAs.\n\n\nPerhaps the most important task of the head TA is to set an example for other TAs.",
