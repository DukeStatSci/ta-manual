This Spring, we are offering over 1900 seats in courses taught by departmental faculty to students from across the globe. Students will range from 450 undergraduates enrolled in their first 100-level course to doctoral students nearing the end of their formal coursework. We want students who take only one or two courses from the department to learn the usefulness, importance, and power of statistical thinking and modern methodologies. We aim to educate our undergraduate majors, minors and interdisciplinary majors, master’s students, and Ph.D. students in particular to be highly accomplished future leaders in statistical science, regardless of their career paths. For all of these students, whatever their programs, we aim to provide a transformative educational experience in statistical and data science. By joining our instructional team, you help us to deliver a meaningful learning experience to each of our students."

    "section": "",
    "text": "TA responsibilities will vary between classes therefore TAs should obtain from the instructor clear guidelines for the specific tasks required of the TA. Many of these tasks are described in general terms below.\n\nComplete all requested training and learn the technology tools required for the course you are assisting.\nAnswer all communications from the department, your instructor, other campus employers, and the university, within 24 hours, before the end of the next business day.\nFamiliarize yourself with the university curriculum and policies:\n\nUndergraduate courses: The undergraduate bulletin (https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/undergraduate-instruction) and T-Reqs (Trinity Requirements) (https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies are sources for Trinity College Academic Policies and Procedures. You are encouraged to review this site for information on university policy on religious holidays, disability accommodations, class attendance, credits, exams and grading, harassment, plagiarism, etc.\nGraduate courses: Review the Graduate Bulletin https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/graduate-school and the Graduate School’s policy site https://gradschool.duke.edu/academics/academic-policies.\n\nGet in touch with the instructor before the first class and be available to meet with the instructor during the first week of class.\nOffice hours:\n\nOffice hours can be in person or remote. We are asking that all courses set up at least some Zoom office hours to accommodate students who are ill or in isolation or stuck traveling. Check with your course instructor for ideal distribution of Zoom / in person office hours.\nIn general, we request that TAs working 8-15 hours per week hold two hours of office hours each week and those working less hold one hour. Your instructor may have different requirements.\nYour primary duty during the office hours is to help students from your course.\n\nLectures: Attend the first live or online class session (if possible and if requested to do so) and discuss with the instructor whether continued attendance is required. For TAs new to a course or the TA experience, attendance throughout the semester is often expected. Ask your instructor about their policy.\nLabs:\n\nProvide your availability to your course instructor for leading / helping out with labs as soon as possible after your TA assignment.\nPrepare for lab sessions by reviewing the lab assignment – this includes running through the assignment, actually running the code and providing feedback to the instructor if anything is incorrect/not clear.\nMeet with your instructor and make sure you understand what is expected of you for that role in that course.\n\nIf you are assigned the duties of a Head TA, see ?sec-head-ta.\nAttend regular meetings with the instructor, typically at least once a week.\nRespond to students’ e-mails, forwarding common questions to the instructor and other TAs (if any). Your instructor will set expectations about the format students will use to answer questions. If the instructor is using Ed Discussions or another tool for Q&A, discuss with the instructor expectations about answers and about how to handle getting students to ask their questions in that tool rather than in emails. You may be asked to cover answering questions on particular days.\nMonitoring performance / keeping pulse of students’ learning:\n\nAssist in assessing and reporting student performance to the instructor. This includes identifying top and/or struggling students and identifying problems or concepts causing difficulty for students. YOUR FEEDBACK IS CRUCIAL TO US!\nLet the instructor and then the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Undergraduate Coordinator know if you think a particular student needs support.\n\nYour other duties and responsibilities might include but are not limited to:\n\nGrade labs, homework assignments, exams, etc. using Gradescope and other tools.\nIf the course has a lab component, review to prepare and then run labs or assist in labs.\nConduct review sessions prior to exams, if the instructor requests.\nHelp maintain the course website or Sakai site.\nWork with student teams on their group projects.\nImprove your teaching skills by training, practice, observations and feedback.\n\nStay available for course related duties until the end of the final exam week.\n\nSpring 2023 final exams end at 10 pm on Saturday, May 6 . Grades are due within 48 hours of the end of the exam period. This means TAs are expected to continue to hold office hours during their respective final exam periods, and to be available for grading final exams in their assigned courses unless they make special arrangements with the course instructor. Please discuss the end of semester plans with the instructor you are assisting right away.\n\nIf you miss a scheduled meeting, training, office hours or other event, immediately contact the instructor.\nTimekeeping:\n\nKeep accurate track of time spent on the course and report to the instructor if your hours are above or below the expected level.\nIf you are paid biweekly, update and save your time card when you finish work for the day and submit promptly before the deadline. If you do not turn in your time card you will not get paid for the hours you worked.\n\nAlways complete the course and TA evaluations in the courses for which you are enrolled as a student."

    "section": "5.1 Before Classes Begin",
    "text": "5.1 Before Classes Begin\n\nTechnology: During training, you will be asked about your ability to use Gradescope for grading and Zoom and whiteboarding for online meetings. It’s fine to use a do-it-yourself hack to turn your cell phone into a document camera aimed at paper or a whiteboard. If needed for a particular course or online office hours, let us know if you lack a tablet and stylus or something to use for written explanations; it is possible to acquire an inexpensive drawing device if you need one for whiteboarding.\nBooks: Many courses now have electronic versions of the text available for free online or through the Duke Libraries. Please check with your instructor first. For some courses, the Assistant to the DUS Mrs. Karen Whitesell (karen.whitesell@duke.edu) has physical desk copies of most books that you may use for TAing the course, but you must return the book at the end of the semester. Please contact her if you need a textbook copy for the course.\nCourse website: Familiarize yourself with the website for the course. This may be a site designed by the instructor or it may be a Sakai site. Sakai is a university wide course development and presentation platform; all courses use Sakai at least for grades. You will need a NetID to access Sakai at http://sakai.duke.edu. It allows faculty (and TAs if the faculty gives permission) to post course information such as lecture notes, assignments, announcements, exam solutions, and other teaching materials to which you want your students to have access. It also will also allow you to send emails to individuals or groups, host online discussions, collect homework assignments, and allow students to view their grades. For an overview of capabilities and various tutorials go to http://support.sakai.duke.edu/sakai-basics. Your TA training may include Sakai training as well. If you have problems with Sakai, let your instructor know. Note that undergraduate TAs are not supposed to have access to the full gradebook in Sakai; however, you may be able to do anonymous grading. Sakai is also able to organize Zoom meetings for the course lectures, labs, and office hours. Check with your instructor or Dr. Durso. Learning Innovation also offers training on Sakai.\nDiscussion tools: Piazza is no longer supported by Duke University but individual instructors may still choose to use it. Alternative discussion tools include Conversations in Sakai, and other tools your instructors may choose. Once your instructor has chosen which tool they will use, ask for training on that tool.\nGradescope: Gradescope is an online grading tool that is usually integrated with Sakai. Gradescope is used extensively in the department and all TAs will be trained on its use. If your instructor is using it, they will explain what they expect. If you have never used it, be sure to ask any questions you have so that you fully understand how to grade in Gradescope. You will access Gradescope using your NetID similarly to accessing Sakai. If you have previously used Gradescope for grading and think it would assist in your course duties this semester, discuss this with your instructor. If you or the instructor would like help with Gradescope, ask Joan Combs Durso, the Coordinator of Undergraduate Training, Research, and Development. We have a training site set up and TAs will provide sample documents for grading training. The workflow for syncing grades from Gradescope to Sakai has changed this semester. Training will be offered if needed.\nCopies: If your instructor asks you to make physical copies for the course, please contact Mrs. Whitesell and cc: Dr. Durso on the email. We’ll get you access and instructions.\nSupplies: Please let your instructor know if you have any unmet supply needs such as chalk, dry-erase markers, red pens, etc. These are only for instructional and grading purposes, not for your personal use. If these items are missing in a TA office hours space, please let Mrs. Whitesell and Dr. Durso know.\nComputing labs: Most introductory undergraduate labs in StatSci are bring-your-own-device labs. Large introductory classes often use OIT provided Docker containers for computing. Graduate courses often use department servers. In remote teaching, the situation is complicated by distance and the need to see the screen of your students. Graduate Teaching Assistants and experienced undergraduates usually supervise the computing lab sections. Get help with the computing environment from Dr. Durso or from Learning Innovation’s online training options.\nCollaboration tools: Whether your instructor is using email, Slack, Basecamp, Microsoft Teams, or any other collaboration tool, make sure you understand how to use it and what your instructor’s preferred communication methods are."

    "text": "5.2 Professionalism\n\nWhether you are attending class with the instructor, leading a lab, or holding office hours online, please recall that you are a leader of students and representing the department. Students may show up to online sessions in pajamas, wrapped in blankets, and attending their session from their beds, but the TA shouldn’t. If students show up inappropriately dressed, please discuss the issue with the instructor.\nUse an appropriate virtual background if needed and if your computer can handle it. Try to be in a boring environment, not in a distracting one. A bookcase or office space, a living room or even a yard are fine backgrounds. Be sure to have adequate lighting. Sometimes it is just a matter of turning to face a different direction. No need to buy a ring light, but there are many YouTube videos that show you how to set up a good environment for leading an online session.\nFor online sessions, if your environment is noisy, use a headset and mute yourself when you are not speaking. Practice in advance where you know you will be, so you can have someone listen to you and make sure the sound is adequate.\nIf you need help with this, please contact Dr. Durso."

    "text": "5.3 Labs\n\nMeet with the course instructor before courses begin and at least once a week during the semester to learn how the instructor would like the lab session run and to discuss upcoming labs and any issues that arise during the semester. First year graduate students have usually not learned about statistics from the same perspective as our undergrad courses, and some have never used the software that they will be teaching. Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Undergraduates may have taken the course from a different instructor whose approach is different. Talk to the instructor of this course!\nDuring the first day of lab, do what you can to set the climate of the course and develop a rapport with the class. Get students to interact with you and their classmates either through introductions, small group discussion, or asking questions. Give information about yourself that helps establish that you are both credible and approachable. You will want students to leave after the first class knowing why the lab sections are important and what your expectations will be. You will want to leave after the first class knowing the students’ expectations and knowing that they are engaged enough to begin expending the time and energy needed to do well in the course.\nMake sure you have worked through the lab ahead of time leaving plenty of time to ask the instructor for clarification. Make sure you understand the general learning objectives. Be ready to explain to students why they are being asked to do the exercise.\nDuring lab, engage the students. Encourage them to explore and play rather than simply go through the motions. Ask them questions. Be receptive to their questions. Help them make the link between the computing lab and what has been covered in the text and lectures.\nCheck in with breakout groups online, even when it looks like there are no questions. Wander around the live classroom or lab. Students are more likely to reach out and ask a question if you’re physically (or virtually) closer to them than if you’re sitting in front of the classroom. Don’t ask the Ferris Bueller query “Any questions?” Instead, “what questions do you have for me?” or “I’ll take 3 questions now” are both better ways to solicit inquiry.\nPlease avoid “didactic dictation”. One of the most frustrating experiences for a new user of R is to have code quickly and sometimes inaudibly dictated to them by an experienced coder who talks too fast while typing in unreadably tiny font on a screen half the class can’t see, and allows no time for correction, troubleshooting, or questions. Live coding, where you are demonstrating something as you talk about it, and students code along, should be done slowly. You don’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to make mistakes and correct them, modeling authentic coding for your students. Demonstrate first, and then have students work on their own code. Watch for frustration. Address it positively.\nExcellent suggestions for how to do this well can be found here.\nIf you have suggestions for improving the lab materials or find errors in the lab instructions, please discuss them with your instructor.\nIt may be a hardship for some students to have to use their cameras during an online lab session, but make sure to set expectations. You can’t see how they are doing if their cameras off the whole session. Try at least starting with cameras on for a check-in. Talk with the instructor about setting expectations. Use activities to keep students engaged even if their cameras are not able to be used."

    "title": "5  Best practices",
    "section": "5.4 Office Hours",
    "text": "5.4 Office Hours\n\nMany instructors will set up Zoom office hours rooms in Sakai. Practices may differ between instructors but it is a good idea to set up a Google sheet that stays linked in Sakai that can be used for students to indicate their question or need. This will help you manage the crowd that could show up. You will find an example of this in the TA training site in Sakai.\nMake sure you have read the text and class notes. Use the same notation, definitions, and perspectives as the author of the text and the instructor of the class.\nMake sure to convey your interest in helping students. Sitting in the help room (or on Zoom) doing your own homework and not making eye contact with an entering student will often convey to the student that you are not interested in helping.\nAvoid solving homework problems for students. Giving students the answer does not help them develop the problem-solving skills that will be necessary for them to do well in the course. Ask guiding, probing questions, but get the student to do the thinking. Offer similar problems as examples to work through, together.\nStudents differ in their mathematical preparation, and for our undergraduate courses, students will often be very rusty on algebra or calculus, depending on the course. Be sure to work from the level of the student. If a student is in trouble beyond your abilities, refer them to the instructor.\nMake sure to speak clearly, slowly, and audibly, whether in person or online. Do not assume that your students knows a particular theorem or distribution if it has not yet been used in the course. Speak respectfully and let them know the course is meant to be challenging but success happens with practice and spending sufficient time on the work.\nWhen you don’t know how to work to the answer, do NOT fake it. Be honest, and seek another TA or the instructor. Giving a student incorrect information will snowball into a larger problem. If you promise to get back to them, write it down and follow it up. Share with your peer TAs or ask in a discussion forum in the TA training site.\nLet the instructor know if you have students who are struggling with the material or who don’t know where to begin. It’s hard for anyone to ask for help if they are not used to needing it. Be kind and patient with students who show up feeling panicked or anxious. Reach out to Duke Reach if you suspect they need help, and let the instructor know. But mostly, be kind. You were a beginner once, and the student genuinely may be lost or have not learned how to study in an online course. Help them, and get help with this if it’s a problem. Kindness and patience are the best compliments in TA evaluations."

Make sure you understand the instructor’s expectations.\nFind out from the instructor whether they expect you to make the solution key or grading rubric, including both answers and a breakdown of how points will be distributed. Ask the instructor to review before it goes live.\nBefore you begin to grade, go through solutions and double check answers, points, etc.\nGrade by question, i.e., grade all of question 1, then all of question 2, etc. This will facilitate greater consistency. You may be assigned only one or a few questions from an entire assignment, especially if you are using Gradescope.\nIf you are sharing grading duties, make sure to calibrate for consistency. Students will be frustrated and angry if graders differ in their process of assigning points (and you will hear about it!).\nRecord grades as per instructions of the instructor, but always double check your work.\nCheck with the instructor on how to enter missing grades, i.e. with a blank or a zero. Blanks can play havoc with scoring algorithms that require replacing minimums. This also depends on whether you are grading with Gradescope or Sakai.\nGrading turnaround deadlines will be set by the instructor. Be sure you understand their expectations and that you communicate your time availability. Gradescope shows what you have already graded and haven’t."

Upcoming workshops are here https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/events/.\nThe Graduate School has many training opportunities for students interested in teaching, see their website at https://gradschool.duke.edu/. Some specific opportunities that might be of interest are listed below.\n\n7.3.1 Certificate in College Teaching\nThe Certificate in College Teaching program both prepares you to do this and formally documents this professional development to make you more competitive when applying for positions. Students who complete the CCT will have it listed on their transcripts as an officially endorsed Duke University Graduate School certificate. The CCT combines departmental training and resources with programming from The Graduate School to give you systematic pedagogical training that not only helps you develop as a teacher, but also allows you to use your time more efficiently as you balance your research and teaching responsibilities. The Certificate in College Teaching program has three major requirements:\n\nCoursework (2 courses, 1 offered in the Department of Statistical Science)\nTeaching experience and observation\nOnline teaching portfolio\n\nThe program requirements take about a year to complete, but that may vary as opportunities for gaining teaching experience vary across departments. CCT work may be done alongside other classes, research, or work on a dissertation, and should not significantly interfere with the timely completion of any of these. After you apply to the CCT program, the program director will meet with you to go over the requirements and your timeline for completing them. Discuss your CCT activities with your instructor and the Department if you need assistance scheduling observations, etc.\nTwo Statistical Science courses have been developed and count towards this Certificate:\n\nSTA 771S - Teaching Statistics\nSTA 772S - Mentoring Undergraduate STEM Research\n\n\n\n7.3.2 BASS Instructional Fellowships\nThe Bass Instructional Fellowship Program supports high-quality teaching experiences for Ph.D. students where normal means of funding are unavailable. It also helps students become more knowledgeable in online college teaching. The program offers fellowships for\n\ninstructors of record (Bass IORs),\ninstructional teaching assistants (Bass TAs), and\nonline apprentices (Bass OAs).\n\nRecipients of Bass Instructional Fellowships will receive compensatory payment at the level of Arts and Sciences teaching assistants (currently $6,000) and a scholarship covering full or partial tuition and fees for their semester of participation. This effectively “buys out” that much of any other existing fellowship or financial support; the student will not net any additional pay. A Bass Instructional Fellowship should not lessen a student’s competitiveness for other fellowships. If the student wins another fellowship after having also won a Bass Fellowship, that other fellowship can be decreased by the amount provided by the Bass Fellowship so that there is no penalty or disadvantage to receiving a Bass at the same time (unless this arrangement is prohibited by terms of the other fellowship).\n\n\n7.3.3 Teaching IDEAS Series\nInstructional Development for Excellence And Success is an annual workshop series open to Duke graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and staff. Invited speakers in this series will draw upon their experience to address topics relevant to classroom teaching, dealing with students, or faculty life and career paths. You will learn how to: - recognize the complex dimensions of classroom teaching and faculty life, - analyze difficult teaching situations and respond creatively, - improve your teaching skills by drawing upon various resources at Duke, - plan and design courses with the student perspective in mind, and - engage in scholarly conversations about college teaching and learning.\n\n\n7.3.4 Duke Learning Innovation\nLearning Innovation is not part of the Graduate School but is dedicated to improving learning at Duke. Learning Innovation provides many opportunities for professional development, including training on Sakai, Gradescope, Piazza, and other instructional tools. They also provide drop-in office hours for help with Sakai or Gradescope as well as workshops and seminars to assist you improve your careers."

    "text": "8.3 Responsibilities\n\n8.3.1 Administrative tasks\nYou may be asked to do some or all of the administrative tasks throughout the semester. You can go through this list with the instructor to determine the tasks that will be part of your Head TA responsibilities.\n\n8.3.1.1 Office hours\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, ensure each TA has scheduled their allotted number of office hours (at least 2 hours weekly) and has the necessary room reserved and/or Zoom links set up.\nEnsure office hours are well distributed throughout the week as much as is feasible to meet the needs of the students.\n\n\n\n8.3.1.2 Total TA hours\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, obtain the number of expected hours for each TA from the instructor and when requested, compare to assigned tasks.\nCheck in with other TAs about the number of hours they’re putting in weekly; adjust grading assignments, as needed, to help keep their hours consistent and within their limits. If the workload cannot be allocated fairly and still keep people within their limits, notify the instructor.\n\n\n\n8.3.1.3 Gradescope\n\nWork with the instructor at the beginning of the semester to make sure all TAs know how to use Gradescope. Give a demonstration or facilitate a help session for TAs, as needed. \nIf requested, set up assignments in Gradescope and Sakai and make the links for synchronization through the Lessons tool in Sakai.\n\nEnsure grading rubrics are set up using the instructor’s preferred grading convention (positive scoring, negative scoring, combination of both).  Include any other rubric items requested by the instructor, such as a “needs review” rubric item.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.1.4 Grading\n\nMake grading assignments for all TAs. Each question should be graded by one TA for all submissions in a given assignment, with a rare exception if this is not feasible for particular questions.\n\nThe number of questions to assign to each TA will be based on total hours allowed and other TA responsibilities (e.g. labs, office hours, classroom). Total hours and responsibilities will be provided by the instructor. \n\nSet up a clear communication line so TAs may ask questions about grading assignments\nMake sure all TAs complete grading (both lab and lecture) within a week (or less during summer). This includes\n\nKeeping track of progress and gently reminding TAs when the grading deadline is approaching.\nSend personal reminders to TAs who have little to no grading completed the day before the deadline. Notify the instructor if any TAs regularly need these reminders.\nIf grading isn’t done by the due date, send the TA a reminder. If you’re unable to contact the TA or grading is still not completed within agreed upon time frame, notify the instructor immediately to follow up with TAs not finishing up their grading.\n\nWhen the grading deadline has passed, do a first pass on graded items marked “needs review” by other TAs, and notify the instructor if any questions need instructor feedback before finalizing.\nSpot check the quality of written feedback and let the TAs know if they need to improve the quality of feedback. (Note: The second Head TA training session will particularly focus on how to do this.)\nWork with the instructor to determine the process for handling regrade requests. If asked by the instructor, do a first pass on regrade requests, providing feedback on each one and notify the instructor if any others need instructor feedback before finalizing.\n\n\n\n8.3.1.5 Additional tasks\n\nAt the end of drop/add, remind instructor to remove any students from the GitHub organization that have dropped the class. \nAt the end of the semester, provide a reflection on how the Head TA role went, whether the training was effective, etc. by responding to the Head TA survey.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Pedagogical tasks\nYou may be asked to do some or all of the pedagogical tasks throughout the semester. You can go through this list with the instructor to determine the tasks that will be part of your Head TA responsibilities.\n\n8.3.2.1 Peer evaluations\n\nSchedule peer evaluations in Teammates or software preferred by instructor. The instructor will provide the dates of the peer evaluation.\nWhen peer evaluations are due, read through the “instructor only” comments and write a one-page summary notifying the instructor how the teams are generally doing, if there are any common pain points in the class (e.g. not scheduling a time to meet), and any groups that may be having trouble. Any especially good groups are nice to mention too!\n\n\n\n8.3.2.2 Review assignments & grading rubric\n\nReview assignment instructions and notify the instructor of anything that may be confusing or unclear. \nReview the grading rubric and notify the instructor of any errors or inconsistencies in the instructions and rubric.\n\nTalk with the instructor at the beginning of the semester to establish expectations on when they will have the grading rubrics ready for review. \n\nMake minor updates and corrections to assignments when requested; instructors are responsible for lab creation and major updates.\nIf it is not feasible to schedule a weekly meeting with all TAs and the instructor due to unavoidable scheduling conflicts, work with instructor to record TA meetings via Zoom and share meeting recordings with other TAs.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most important task of the head TA is to set an example for other TAs."

Unless there is a very specific reason, do not decrease this cadence.\nManaging the Sakai Gradebook. The instructor may not grant teaching assistants (including the Head TA) access to the Gradebook in Sakai unless there is a very specific reason to do so. Note that the university prohibits undergraduate TAs from having access to the Sakai Gradebook entirely.\nCheck in with Head TA during Week 3 and Week 6 about workload. If there are concerns with workload, assign another TA (graduate student or advanced undergraduate) to help with some Head TA responsibilities or reach out to DUS for more resources, if needed."

Student and faculty evaluations of TAs will occur at the end of each semester via surveys. Excellent TA evaluations can also provide the basis for future recommendation letters from faculty. TAs will be able to review their evaluations at the end of each semester.\nWe also recommend getting feedback from your students during the semester. If your instructor does not do a midcourse survey for anonymous feedback from students and you wish to set up one for yourself, please contact Dr. Durso for help with a Qualtrics survey."
