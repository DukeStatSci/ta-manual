<ul>
<li><p>Trinity resources: The undergraduate bulletin (<a href="https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/undergraduate-instruction" class="uri">https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/undergraduate-instruction</a>) and T-Reqs (Trinity Requirements) (<a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies" class="uri">https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies</a> are sources for Trinity College Academic Policies and Procedures. You are encouraged to review this site for information on university policy on religious holidays, disability accommodations, class attendance, credits, exams and grading, harassment, plagiarism, etc. For graduate courses, use the Graduate Bulletin <a href="https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/graduate-school" class="uri">https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/graduate-school</a> and the Graduate School’s policy site <a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/academics/academic-policies" class="uri">https://gradschool.duke.edu/academics/academic-policies</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Technology: During training, you will be asked about your ability to use Gradescope for grading and Zoom and whiteboarding for online meetings. It’s fine to use a do-it-yourself hack to turn your cell phone into a document camera aimed at paper or a whiteboard. If needed for a particular course or online office hours, let us know if you lack a tablet and stylus or something to use for written explanations; it is possible to acquire an inexpensive drawing device if you need one for whiteboarding. Also let us know your Wi-Fi situation. Talk with your instructor and Dr. Durso.</p></li>
<li><p>Books: Many courses now have electronic versions of the text available for free online or through the Duke Libraries. Please check with your instructor first. For some courses, the Assistant to the DUS Mrs. Karen Whitesell (<a href="mailto:karen.whitesell@duke.edu" class="email">karen.whitesell@duke.edu</a>) has physical desk copies of most books that you may use for TAing the course, but you must return the book at the end of the semester. Please contact her if you need a textbook copy for the course.</p></li>
<li><p>Course website: Familiarize yourself with the website for the course. This may be a site designed by the instructor or it may be a Sakai site. Sakai is a university wide course development and presentation platform; all courses use Sakai at least for grades. You will need a NetID to access Sakai at <a href="http://sakai.duke.edu" class="uri">http://sakai.duke.edu</a>. It allows faculty (and TAs if the faculty gives permission) to post course information such as lecture notes, assignments, announcements, exam solutions, and other teaching materials to which you want your students to have access. It also will also allow you to send emails to individuals or groups, host online discussions, collect homework assignments, and allow students to view their grades. For an overview of capabilities and various tutorials go to <a href="http://support.sakai.duke.edu/sakai-basics" class="uri">http://support.sakai.duke.edu/sakai-basics</a>. Your TA training may include Sakai training as well. If you have problems with Sakai, let your instructor know. Note that undergraduate TAs are not supposed to have access to the gradebook in Sakai; however, you may be able to do anonymous grading. Sakai is also able to organize Zoom meetings for the course lectures, labs, and office hours. Check with your instructor or Dr. Durso. Learning Innovation also offers training on Sakai.</p></li>
<li><p>Discussion tools: Piazza is no longer supported by Duke University but individual instructors may still choose to use it. Alternative discussion tools are ED Discussion, Conversations in Sakai, and traditional discussion Forums in Sakai. Once your instructor has chosen which tool they will use, we will make training available on that tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradescope: Gradescope is an online grading tool that is usually integrated with
Sakai. Gradescope is used extensively in the department and all TAs will be trained on its use. If your instructor is using it, they will explain what they expect. If you have never used it, be sure to ask any questions you have so that you fully understand how to grade in Gradescope. You will access Gradescope using your NetID similarly to accessing Sakai. If you have previously used Gradescope for grading and think it would assist in your course duties this semester, discuss this with your instructor. If you or the instructor would like help with Gradescope, ask Joan Combs Durso, the Coordinator of Undergraduate Training, Research, and Development. We have a training site set up and TAs will provide sample documents for grading training. Over the course of the semester, we will put in place more procedures for anonymizing grading.</p></li>
<li><p>Copies: Copy procedures are changing. If your instructor asks you to make physical copies for the course, please contact Mrs. Whitesell and cc: Dr. Durso on the email. We’ll get you access and instructions.</p></li>
<li><p>Supplies: Please let your instructor know if you have any unmet supply needs such as chalk, dry-erase markers, red pens, etc. These are only for instructional and grading purposes, not for your personal use. If these items are missing in a TA office hours space, please let Mrs. Whitesell and Dr. Durso know.</p></li>
<li><p>Computing labs: Most introductory undergraduate labs in StatSci are held virtually as the department has shifted from physical computing labs to bring-your-own-device labs. In remote teaching, the situation is complicated by distance and the need to see the screen of your students. Graduate Teaching Assistants (and some experienced undergraduates) usually supervise the computing lab sections; undergraduate TAs may be lab helpers, so it is important that you check out the virtual lab or classroom environment well in advance of the class to make sure you understand how it will function for students. Get help with the Zoom environment from Dr. Durso or from Learning Innovation’s online training options.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration Tools: Whether your instructor is using email, Slack, Basecamp, Microsoft
Teams, or any other collaboration tool, make sure you understand how to use it and what your instructor’s preferred communication methods are.</p></li>
