<p>Workshops and more training opportunities are available from Learning Innovation and the Graduate School. Upcoming workshops are here <a href="https://flexteaching.li.duke.edu/fall-2020/workshops/" class="uri">https://flexteaching.li.duke.edu/fall-2020/workshops/</a> and recorded workshops are here <a href="https://flexteacdhing.li.duke.edu/fall-2020/workshops/recorded-workshops/" class="uri">https://flexteacdhing.li.duke.edu/fall-2020/workshops/recorded-workshops/</a>. (Yes, these are the correct links for Fall 2021.)</p>
<p>The Graduate School has many training opportunities for students interested in teaching, see their website at <a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/" class="uri">https://gradschool.duke.edu/</a>. Some specific opportunities that might be of interest are</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Certificate in College Teaching</h3>
<p><a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching" class="uri">https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching</a></p>
<p>The Certificate in College Teaching program both prepares you to do this and formally documents this professional development to make you more competitive when applying for positions. Students who complete the CCT will have it listed on their transcripts as an officially endorsed Duke University Graduate School certificate. The CCT combines departmental training and resources with programming from The Graduate School to give you systematic pedagogical training that not only helps you develop as a teacher, but also allows you to use your time more efficiently as you balance your research and teaching responsibilities. The Certificate in College Teaching program has three major requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Coursework (2 courses, 1 offered in the Department of Statistical Science)</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching experience and observation</p></li>
<li><p>Online teaching portfolio</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The program requirements take about a year to complete, but that may vary as opportunities for gaining teaching experience vary across departments. CCT work may be done alongside other classes, research, or work on a dissertation, and should not significantly interfere with the timely completion of any of these. After you apply to the CCT program, the program director will meet with you to go over the requirements and your timeline for completing them. Discuss your CCT activities with your instructor and the Department if you need assistance scheduling observations, etc.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> BASS Instructional Fellowships</h3>
<p><a href="https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/bass-instructional-fellowships" class="uri">https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/bass-instructional-fellowships</a></p>
<p>The Bass Instructional Fellowship Program supports high-quality teaching experiences for Ph.D. students where normal means of funding are unavailable. It also helps students become more knowledgeable in online college teaching. The program offers fellowships for</p>
<ul>
<li>instructors of record (Bass IORs),</li>
<li>instructional teaching assistants (Bass TAs), and</li>
<li>online apprentices (Bass OAs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Recipients of Bass Instructional Fellowships will receive compensatory payment at the level of Arts and Sciences teaching assistants (currently $6,000) and a scholarship covering full or partial tuition and fees for their semester of participation. This effectively “buys out” that much of any other existing fellowship or financial support; the student will not net any additional pay. A Bass Instructional Fellowship should not lessen a student’s competitiveness for other fellowships. If the student wins another fellowship after having also won a Bass Fellowship, that other fellowship can be decreased by the amount provided by the Bass Fellowship so that there is no penalty or disadvantage to receiving a Bass at the same time (unless this arrangement is prohibited by terms of the other fellowship).</p>
