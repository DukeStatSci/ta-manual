title: "Responsibilties "
---

TA responsibilities will vary between classes therefore TAs should obtain from the instructor clear guidelines for the specific tasks required of the TA. Many of these tasks are described in general terms below.

-   Complete all requested training and learn the technology tools required for the course you are assisting.

-   Answer all communications from the department, your instructor, other campus employers, and the university, within 24 hours, before the end of the next business day.

-   Familiarize yourself with the university curriculum and policies:

    -   Undergraduate courses: The undergraduate bulletin (<https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/undergraduate-instruction>) and T-Reqs (Trinity Requirements) (<https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies> are sources for Trinity College Academic Policies and Procedures. You are encouraged to review this site for information on university policy on religious holidays, disability accommodations, class attendance, credits, exams and grading, harassment, plagiarism, etc.

    -   Graduate courses: Review the Graduate Bulletin <https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/graduate-school> and the Graduate School's policy site <https://gradschool.duke.edu/academics/academic-policies>.

-   Get in touch with the instructor before the first class and be available to meet with the instructor during the first week of class.

-   Office hours:

    -   Office hours can be in person or remote. We are asking that all courses set up at least some Zoom office hours to accommodate students who are ill or in isolation or stuck traveling. Check with your course instructor for ideal distribution of Zoom / in person office hours.

    -   In general, we request that TAs working 8-15 hours per week hold two hours of office hours each week and those working less hold one hour. Your instructor may have different requirements.

    -   Your primary duty during the office hours is to help students from your course.

-   Lectures: Attend the first live or online class session (if possible and if requested to do so) and discuss with the instructor whether continued attendance is required. For TAs new to a course or the TA experience, attendance throughout the semester is often expected. Ask your instructor about their policy.

-   Labs:

    -   Provide your availability to your course instructor for leading / helping out with labs as soon as possible after your TA assignment.

    -   Prepare for lab sessions by reviewing the lab assignment -- this includes running through the assignment, actually running the code and providing feedback to the instructor if anything is incorrect/not clear.

    -   Meet with your instructor and make sure you understand what is expected of you for that role in that course.

-   If you are assigned the duties of a Head TA, see @sec-head-ta.

-   Attend regular meetings with the instructor, typically at least once a week.

-   Respond to students' e-mails, forwarding common questions to the instructor and other TAs (if any). Your instructor will set expectations about the format students will use to answer questions. If the instructor is using Ed Discussions or another tool for Q&A, discuss with the instructor expectations about answers and about how to handle getting students to ask their questions in that tool rather than in emails. You may be asked to cover answering questions on particular days.

-   Monitoring performance / keeping pulse of students' learning:

    -   Assist in assessing and reporting student performance to the instructor. This includes identifying top and/or struggling students and identifying problems or concepts causing difficulty for students. YOUR FEEDBACK IS CRUCIAL TO US!

    -   Let the instructor and then the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Undergraduate Coordinator know if you think a particular student needs support.

-   Your other duties and responsibilities might include but are not limited to:

    -   Grade labs, homework assignments, exams, etc. using Gradescope and other tools.
    -   If the course has a lab component, review to prepare and then run labs or assist in labs.
    -   Conduct review sessions prior to exams, if the instructor requests.
    -   Help maintain the course website or Sakai site.
    -   Work with student teams on their group projects.
    -   Improve your teaching skills by training, practice, observations and feedback.

-   Stay available for course related duties until the end of the final exam week.

    -   **Spring 2023 final exams end at 10 pm on Saturday, May 6 .** Grades are due within 48 hours of the end of the exam period. This means TAs are expected to continue to hold office hours during their respective final exam periods, and to be available for grading final exams in their assigned courses unless they make special arrangements with the course instructor. Please discuss the end of semester plans with the instructor you are assisting right away.

-   If you miss a scheduled meeting, training, office hours or other event, immediately contact the instructor.

-   Timekeeping:

    -   Keep accurate track of time spent on the course and report to the instructor if your hours are above or below the expected level.

    -   If you are paid biweekly, update and save your time card when you finish work for the day and submit promptly before the deadline. If you do not turn in your time card you will not get paid for the hours you worked.

-   **Always complete the course and TA evaluations in the courses for which you are enrolled as a student.**
