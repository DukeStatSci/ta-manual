## Remote Learning

This semester, we are starting classes remotely until January 18th. All office hours and labs will be remote as well until we hear otherwise.

## What if you get sick?

If you become ill or have an emergency and are unable to perform your assigned duties, please see to your own immediate needs (https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/studenthealth). Then let the instructor know as soon as you can and also let Dr. Durso know. If you are a graduate student, please also let Lori Rauch know in the StatSci Department by emailing her at lori-rauch@duke.edu. Follow the guidelines found at https://coronavirus.duke.edu/. 

## What if someone else gets sick?

What if the instructor stops showing up? Contact the DUS right away.

What if another TA stops showing up?  Contact the instructor right away.

What if a student stops showing up? Tell the instructor and the DUS.
